# Rute
## Objective
Rute aims to be a data-interchange file format that can be used as a more concise alternative to XML.
## Example
```
inbox {
  email [
    (to "Max", from "Gracie", content "Hello brother, how are you?")
    (to "Gracie", from "Max", content "I'm doing quite well, thank you!")
  ]
}
```
